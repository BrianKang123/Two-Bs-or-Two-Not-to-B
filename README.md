# Brian Kang, Brian Wang, Ethan Lam
## Project Description:
#### We created a playable Rock-Paper-Scissors game with a twist! Starting off, the AI will play random, but the AI will slowly learn and adapt to your moves!

## How to Launch:
##### 1. Do `git clone git@github.com:BrianKang123/Two-Bs-or-Two-Not-to-B.git` in your terminal
##### 2. Run `cd Two-Bs-or-Two-Not-to-B/Master`
##### 3. Run `javac rpsDriver.java`
##### 4. Run `java rpsDriver` OR `java rpsDriver name` where name is the name of the bot you want to play
##### 5. Enter your move, with either `0, 1, 2`, or by typing out your move.

## Different Bot Opponents:
##### v0 - Disfunctional skeleton
##### v1 - Brian (Random Choice Bot)
##### v2 - Gilgamesh (Analyzes Patterns in Playstyle To Make Next Move- Quality)
##### v3 - Eobard (Keeps Track of Previous Moves You Have Played and Will Play Advantageous Moves- Quantity)
##### v4 - Enkidu (Smarter Gilgamesh With Improved Prediction Capabilities)
